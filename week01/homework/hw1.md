{{ From the article by Phillip Guo, I took away that while it is important to understand command-line and otherconfusing computer science skills, it does not make you a bad programmer if you do not know them. He emphasizedthat he works with his students to make sure they do not get discouraged by the confusing command-line part ofprogramming, because this is not the most important part of their work. From the article by Eytan Adar, I learnedthat although the command-line bullshittery is not necessarily important, it is important to learn the skills that arenecessary to overcome such bullshittery. He says that if we do not teach students the skills they need to understandthese topics, they will not have the skills they need to figure out other problems that they face, which will causethem to give up on computer science just because they do not know the skills to overcome the command line.}}
