```

## Question 10
``` 10
Git grep does not search untracked files, and I tested this by making a new file that contains the phrase "insert_list" in my local repo and then running git grep. When I did this, the file that I had just made but not staged or committed did not show up in the list produced.
```

## Question 11
``` 11
Git grep does search staged files that have not yet been committed. To test this, I made a file named test_file that contained the phrase "insert_list", and then I used git add insert_list to stage the file. When I ran git grep again, the text from test_file showed up in the list produced, so I know that git grep must search tracked but uncommitted files.
